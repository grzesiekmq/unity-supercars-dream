Similar to UnityEngine Rigidbody. Control of an object's position and rotation through TF physics simulation.

A rigid body has various properties from the point of view of the simulation. Some properties change over time:
- Linear velocity.
- Angular velocity. 

Other body properties are usually constant over time:
- Mass of the body.
- Position of the center of mass with respect to the point of reference. In the current implementation the center of mass and the point of reference must coincide.
- Inertia matrix. This is a 3x3 matrix that describes how the body's mass is distributed around the center of mass.
