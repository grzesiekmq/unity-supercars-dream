Similar to UnityEngine Collider. This is used to generate detailed collision information.

It requires a UnityEngine Collider (and UnityEngine Rigidbody if collider is moving). These are used for first pass collision detection, to detect that two GameObjects are potentially colliding.
TFCollider will automatically set the UnityEngine Collider to trigger and the UnityEngine Rigidbody to kinematics. 

TFCollider will take parameters (size, radius) from the UnityEngine Collider.
