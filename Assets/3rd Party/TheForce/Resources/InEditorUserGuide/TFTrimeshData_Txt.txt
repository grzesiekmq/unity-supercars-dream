It is TFTrimeshData to be used by a triangle mesh collider.
TFTrimeshData contains all triangles information in an optimised way. It is a ScriptableObject (belongs to the Unity project, not the scene) and can be used by many instances of TFTrimesh.
Current optimisation is the use of an octree, where the root is level 0
TFTrimeshData can be constructed from a Mesh. A lot of the processing is done offline.

1. It is first created using Tools/The Force Engine/Create TFTrimeshData
2. Assign a Mesh
3. Set Min Level and Max Level of recursion in the octree
4. Press Create from Mesh

Then you can assign the TFTrimeshData to a TFTrimesh in the scene
