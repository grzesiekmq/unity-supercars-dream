It is a terrain collider that uses TFTerrainData as data.
TFTerrainData contains all triangles information in an optimised way. It is a ScriptableObject (belongs to the Unity project, not the scene) and can be used by many instances of TFTerrain.
TFTrimeshData can be constructed from a Texture.

1. It is first created using Tools/The Force Engine/Create TFTerrainData
2. Assign a Texture
3. Press Create from Texture (non-welded vertices) or Create from Texture Smooth

Then you can assign the TFTerrainData to a TFTerrain in the scene.
