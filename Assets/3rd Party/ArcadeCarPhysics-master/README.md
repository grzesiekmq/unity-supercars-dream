## About

My attempts to make a fun vehicle physics and arcade control.
The primary goal was to make a vehicle controller which is easy to set up and fun to play with.
I'm pretty happy with the results. This approach can be used for games like GTA, Rocket League or Flatout.

Warning: This is not a final product! This is only my thoughts on the topic.

You can download precompiled demo from releases page:
https://github.com/SergeyMakeev/ArcadeCarPhysics/releases/tag/1.0

Demo video available:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCuJi2pntOw

Key things:

* Speed Curve (instead of complicated engine settings)

* Stable Suspension

* Stablizier Bar Forces

* Ackermann Steering

* Downforce

* Normalized Tire laterial friction

* Handbrakes

* In-flight vehicle stabilization


This demo is made using Unity game engine.
It should be easy to implement this algorithm on any other game/physics engine.
